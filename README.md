# Project2-Tower_of_Hanoi_Visualizer-
The **Tower of Hanoi Visualizer** is a C++ console application that solves the Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion. It visually demonstrates the movement of disks between three towers through ASCII art. Users input the number of disks, and the program illustrates each move, enhancing understanding of this classic algorithmic challenge.
# Tower of Hanoi Visualizer

This project implements a Tower of Hanoi visualizer in C++. The program uses recursion to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem and provides an ASCII-based visual output to illustrate the movement of disks between three towers.

## Features

- Recursively solves the Tower of Hanoi problem.
- Displays the current state of the towers after each move.
- Provides a visual representation of disk movements using ASCII art.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- C++11 or later for `std::this_thread::sleep_for`

## How to Compile and Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tower-of-hanoi-visualizer.git
   cd tower-of-hanoi-visualizer
